    "DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT, which is a bidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence prediction on a large corpus. And, Google Vertex AI is a Machine Learning (ML) platform that lets you train and deploy ML models and AI applications, and customize large language models (LLMs) for use in your AI-powered applications. This example showcases how to deploy any supported PyTorch model from the Hugging Face Hub, in this case [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english), on Vertex AI using the PyTorch Inference DLC available in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in both CPU and GPU instances."
