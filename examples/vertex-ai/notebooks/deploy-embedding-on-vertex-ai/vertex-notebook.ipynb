    "BGE, standing for BAAI General Embedding, is a collection of embedding models released by BAAI, which is an English base model for general embedding tasks ranked in the MTEB Leaderboard. Text Embeddings Inference (TEI) is a toolkit developed by Hugging Face for deploying and serving open source text embeddings and sequence classification models; enabling high-performance extraction for the most popular models, including FlagEmbedding, Ember, GTE and E5. And, Google Vertex AI is a Machine Learning (ML) platform that lets you train and deploy ML models and AI applications, and customize large language models (LLMs) for use in your AI-powered applications. This example showcases how to deploy any supported embedding model, in this case [`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5), from the Hugging Face Hub on Vertex AI using the TEI DLC available in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in both CPU and GPU instances."
