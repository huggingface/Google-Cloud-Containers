And, Google Vertex AI is a Machine Learning (ML) platform that lets you train and deploy ML models and AI applications, and customize large language models (LLMs) for use in your AI-powered applications.\n",

Additionally, the Hugging Face DLCs for TGI also capture the `AIP_` environment variables from Vertex AI as in [Vertex AI Documentation - Custom container requirements for prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements).\n",

    "    * `MODEL_ID` is the identifier of the model in the Hugging Face Hub. To explore all the supported models you can check <https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&other=text-generation-inference>.\n",
    "    * `NUM_SHARD` is the number of shards to use if you don't want to use all GPUs on a given machine e.g. if you have two GPUs but you just want to use one for TGI then `NUM_SHARD=1`, otherwise it matches the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.\n",
    "    * `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` is the maximum allowed input length (expressed in number of tokens), the larger it is, the larger the prompt can be, but also more memory will be consumed.\n",
    "    * `MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS` is the most important value to set as it defines the \"memory budget\" of running clients requests, the larger this value, the larger amount each request will be in your RAM and the less effective batching can be.\n",
    "    * `MAX_BATCH_PREFILL_TOKENS` limits the number of tokens for the prefill operation, as it takes the most memory and is compute bound, it is interesting to limit the number of requests that can be sent.\n",
    "    * `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` is the Hugging Face Hub token, required as [`google/gemma-7b-it`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it) is a gated model.\n",
