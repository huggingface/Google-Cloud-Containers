    "PaliGemma 2 is the latest multilingual vision-language model released by Google. It combines the SigLIP vision model with the Gemma 2 language model, enabling it to process both images and text inputs to generate text outputs for various tasks, including captioning, visual question answering, and object detection. Hugging Face PyTorch Training DLC is a container that comes with all the Hugging Face and PyTorch dependencies required to fine-tune any model ranging from Transformers, Diffusers, and Sentence Transformers installed. Google Vertex AI is a Machine Learning (ML) platform that lets you train and deploy ML models and AI applications, and customize large language models (LLMs) for use in your AI-powered applications.\n",

    "At this stage, both the dataset and the base model have been downloaded and are stored within a bucket, and both artifacts are provided as an input to the fine-tuning component, meaning that there's a dependency on the graph, so that for the fine-tuning to start both artifacts need to be downloaded successfully. In this component, you will need to install `ray[train]` to leverage Ray within the fine-tuning script for distributed fine-tuning across multiple GPUs (4 x NVIDIA L4). The `train_func` i.e. the fine-tuning function, uses `peft` to create the \"fine-tuneable\" LoRA adapter and the `transformers.Trainer` to fine-tune it, and finally the model is saved into the artifact path for the output model i.e. written into the bucket."
