# Examples

This directory contains some usage examples for the Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) available in Google Cloud, as published from the [containers](../containers) directory.

The examples structure is organized based on the Google Cloud service we can use to deploy the containers, being Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on one end, and Vertex AI on the other.
